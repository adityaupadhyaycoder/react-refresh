## Transitive Dependency

A transitive dependency occurs when a module or package depends on another module indirectly through one or more intermediate dependencies. In other words, if package A depends on package B, and package B depends on package C, then package A has a transitive dependency on package C. Managing transitive dependencies is important to ensure compatibility, avoid conflicts, and maintain security in software projects.
